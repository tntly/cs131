assignment 2:

1)
a. The command looks for files inside the /etc directory as well as its subdirectories. Then, the output of the command which is a list of files is redirected to one.txt, and if there are any errors, they are redirected to two.txt.

b. The content of one.txt is a list of files that are inside the /etc directory and its subdirectories. The content of two.txt is a list of errors that the command generated.

2) As per the dataset, top 3 [Year, Month] with the most number of YouTube channels created were:
a. 2006, Mar with 15 channels
b. 2014, Jul with 13 channels
c. 2014, Aug with 12 channels

The command used to find it was: cut -d',' -f20,21 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n3

First, I used the cut command and specified the comma as the delimiter using the -d option. The -f option specified the columns I wanted to extract from the file, which were the 20th and 21st columns. The columns are the created_year and created_month. Next, I used the sort command so that the duplicate lines are adjacent to each other. With the duplicate lines next to each other, I used the uniq command with the -c option to count the repeated lines. Finally, I sorted the results with the sort command with the -n option (a numerical sorting) and the -r option (the reverse order), which gave me the number of times each [Year, Month| appeared in the dataset in descending order. Finally, I used head -n3 to get the top 3 [Year, Month].

b. I noticed that there are 2 different bash processes, which correspond to the 2 terminals. Additionally, since I opened vi in the first terminal, there was a vim process. The process ID of vim was 2675376.

d. The vim process disappeared since I closed down vi in the first terminal.

The init proces in Linux is the first process started by the kernel during the booting of the OS. Its process ID is 1.

6) The ps aux command lists all running processes on the system in a detailed format. The -a option shows processes for all users, while the -u displays the user of a process. Finally, the -x option includes processes that are not attached to a terminal.
